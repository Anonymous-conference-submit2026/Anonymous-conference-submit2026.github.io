<h1>Theorem 2 — Polynomial Approximation of the Accuracy Functional</h1>

<p>
In this section, we establish that the accuracy functional arising from structured pruning 
can be uniformly approximated by finite‑order bivariate polynomials.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<p>Let</p>

$$
\mathcal D=\{0,\tfrac{1}{L},\dots,1\}^2 \subset [0,1]^2
$$

<p>
denote the discrete set of admissible pruning ratios.  
The accuracy functional evaluated at these ratios is denoted
</p>

$$
\mathcal P:\mathcal D\to\mathbb R.
$$

<p>
We assume that \(\mathcal P\) admits a continuous extension
</p>

$$
\tilde{\mathcal P}:[0,1]^2\to\mathbb R,
\qquad
\tilde{\mathcal P}|_{\mathcal D}=\mathcal P.
$$

<h3>1.1 Justification of the Continuity Assumption</h3>

<p>This assumption is natural and well‑motivated for two reasons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Intermediate pruning ratios as relaxed constraints.</b>
    Although structured pruning decisions are discrete, any intermediate pruning ratio
    $$
    (\tilde m_a,\tilde m_g)\in[0,1]^2
    $$
    can be interpreted as a continuous relaxation akin to unstructured pruning.
    Continuous sparsity relaxations are standard in pruning theory, and model performance
    typically varies smoothly with respect to the imposed sparsity level.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Empirically observed smoothness in one‑dimensional pruning.</b>
    When pruning is restricted to one dimension:
    $$
    (\tilde m_a,0)
    \quad\text{or}\quad
    (0,\tilde m_g),
    $$
    empirical results show that validation accuracy evolves <b>smoothly</b> with the pruning ratio.
    This strongly suggests a smooth two‑dimensional accuracy surface.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
These considerations jointly justify modeling the accuracy surface 
as a continuous mapping on \([0,1]^2\).
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Lemma 1 — Compactness and Regularity of the Domain</h2>

<p><b>Lemma.</b>  
The domain \([0,1]^2\) is a compact Hausdorff space.</p>

<p><b>Proof.</b>  
Each interval \([0,1]\) is compact and Hausdorff.  
Products of compact Hausdorff spaces remain compact and Hausdorff.  
Thus \([0,1]^2\) satisfies the topological assumptions required 
for the Stone–Weierstrass theorem.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Lemma 2 — Polynomial Algebra as a Separating Lattice</h2>

<p><b>Lemma.</b> Let</p>

$$
A = \mathbb R[x,y]
$$

<p>
be the algebra of all finite‑order real polynomials in two variables.  
Then \(A\) is a separating lattice that contains constants.
</p>

<p><b>Proof.</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Point separation.</b>  
    For distinct points \((x_1,y_1)\neq(x_2,y_2)\),  
    $$
    p(x,y)=x \quad\text{or}\quad p(x,y)=y
    $$
    separates the two points.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Contains constants.</b>  
    The constant function \(1\) belongs to \(A\).
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Lattice property.</b>  
    For any \(a,b\in A\),
    $$
    \max(a,b)=\frac{a+b}{2}+\frac{|a-b|}{2},\qquad
    \min(a,b)=\frac{a+b}{2}-\frac{|a-b|}{2}.
    $$
    The function \(|a-b|\) can be uniformly approximated on \([0,1]^2\) by polynomials.  
    Thus the uniform closure of \(A\) is closed under max and min.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, \(A\) satisfies all algebraic and lattice requirements.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Theorem 2 — Uniform Approximation of the Accuracy Functional</h2>

<p><b>Theorem.</b>  
Let \(\tilde{\mathcal P}\in C([0,1]^2)\).  
Then for every \(\varepsilon>0\),  
there exists a polynomial 
</p>

$$
Q(x,y)\in\mathbb R[x,y]
$$

<p>such that</p>

$$
\sup_{(x,y)\in[0,1]^2}
|\tilde{\mathcal P}(x,y)-Q(x,y)|
<\varepsilon.
$$

<p>In particular,</p>

$$
\max_{(\tilde m_a,\tilde m_g)\in\mathcal D}
|\mathcal P(\tilde m_a,\tilde m_g)-Q(\tilde m_a,\tilde m_g)|
<\varepsilon.
$$

<hr>

<h2>Proof of Theorem 2</h2>

<p><b>Proof.</b>  
By Lemma 1, the domain \([0,1]^2\) is compact and Hausdorff.  
By Lemma 2, the polynomial algebra  
\(A=\mathbb R[x,y]\)  
is a separating lattice containing constants.
</p>

<p>
Thus all hypotheses of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem (lattice version) are satisfied.
Therefore,
</p>

$$
\overline{A} = C([0,1]^2)
$$

<p>
where \(\overline{A}\) denotes the uniform closure of \(A\).
Hence for every \(\varepsilon>0\), 
there exists a polynomial \(Q\in A\) such that
</p>

$$
\sup_{(x,y)\in[0,1]^2}
|\tilde{\mathcal P}(x,y)-Q(x,y)|
<\varepsilon.
$$

<p>
Since \(\mathcal D\subset[0,1]^2\),  
the same uniform bound holds on \(\mathcal D\):
</p>

$$
\max_{(\tilde m_a,\tilde m_g)\in\mathcal D}
|\mathcal P(\tilde m_a,\tilde m_g)-Q(\tilde m_a,\tilde m_g)|
<\varepsilon.
$$

<p>
Therefore, the accuracy functional can be uniformly approximated over all feasible pruning configurations by a finite‑degree bivariate polynomial.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Remark</h2>

<p>
This theorem provides a rigorous mathematical justification for polynomial‑based 
surrogate modeling (e.g., MAP) in pruning‑ratio optimization.  
In particular, it ensures that the empirical accuracy surface can be captured 
with arbitrarily small uniform error.
